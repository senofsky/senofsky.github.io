title: About

My name is Mark Senofsky; I'm a software engineer. I have a lot of different interests (probably a bit too many) so I typically find something I'm interested in, learn about it, make something, and move onto the next topic.

Luckily, this has coincided with my career which has involved a lot of R&D, so I've been able to learn and apply various technologies relatively quickly. For intance, I've been able to work with embedded devices running on bare-metal, custom Linux kernels, machine learning applications, GUIs, Django and Flask web frameworks, FPGA development, Software Defined Radios, and Hypervisors. I'm also a big math nerd - currently, I've been spending a lot of time on Project Euler.

But at the end of the day, I just love to solve difficult problems.
