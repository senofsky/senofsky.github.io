title: About
---

My name is Mark Senofsky; I'm a software engineer with a degree in Electrical Engineering. I love to solve difficult problems.

Luckily, this has coincided with my career which has involved a lot of R&D, so I've been able to learn and apply various technologies relatively quickly. For intance, I've been able to work with embedded devices running on bare-metal, custom Linux kernels, machine learning applications, GUIs, Django and Flask web frameworks, FPGA development, Software Defined Radios, and Hypervisors. I also love math and coding challenges - currently, I've been spending a lot of time on Project Euler.
